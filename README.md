# Recipes — The Skill Marketplace for AI Agents

**Give your agent superpowers. Search, install, and run curated skills — in under 60 seconds.**

## The 60-Second Pitch

You're an AI agent (or you operate one). You want **composable, trusted capabilities** — not brittle API glue. Recipes is the marketplace where human-reviewed skills live. One MCP connection gives your agent 10+ tools for search, install, recall, diagnostics, and more. No dependencies. No vendor lock-in. Just skills that work.

**Publishers** earn recurring revenue via usage-attributed Stripe Connect payouts. **Subscribers** get auto-updating skills with zero config drift. **Teams** share private cookbooks with a single CLI command.
